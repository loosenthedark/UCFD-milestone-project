These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.\n\n -->\n \n## Features\n\n<!-- In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. -->\n\n\n\n\n### Features Left to Implement\n\n<!-- Another feature idea -->\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n<!-- In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.\n\nJQuery\nThe project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation. -->\n\n## Testing\n\n<!-- In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.\n\nWhenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.\n\nFor any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:\n\nContact form:\nGo to the \"Contact Us\" page\nTry to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears\nTry to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears\nTry to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.\nIn addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.\n\nYou should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.\n\nIf this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->\n\n## Deployment\n\n<!-- This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).\n\nIn particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:\n\nDifferent values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?\nDifferent configuration files?\nSeparate git branch?\n\nIn addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally. -->\n\n## Credits\n\n\n\n### Content\n\n<!-- The text for section Y was copied from the Wikipedia article Z -->\n\n### Media\n\n<!-- The photos used in this site were obtained from ... -->\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n<!-- I received inspiration for this project from X -->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-mention about using TinyJPG for images (c/o @Anthony_lead on Slack)\n\n-credit Wiki for blog intro blurbs (external links)\n\nFavicon credit: <div>Icons made by <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/authors/gregor-cresnar\" title=\"Gregor Cresnar\">Gregor Cresnar</a> from <a href=\"https://www.flaticon.com/\"                 title=\"Flaticon\">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\"                 title=\"Creative Commons BY 3.0\" target=\"_blank\">CC 3.0 BY</a></div>\n\napplying border-radius to contact form properly (overflow: hidden):\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6312067/border-radius-background-color-cropped-border\n\nHover.css used at bottom of FAQ section, as well as in Blog and Footer sections:\n\nhttp://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/\nhttps://github.com/IanLunn/Hover\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom original Bino theme README.......\n\n== Theme Name: Bino - Free HTML5 Landing Page Template\n\n== Copyright (c) 2016 BootstrapThemes.co\n\n== http://BootstrapThemes.co\n\n\n1.
